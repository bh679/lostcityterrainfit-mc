/**
 * Lets the Lost City's buildings sit in the world's own ground instead of on their template's pad.
 *
 * <p>Every Big Lost City template carries a fully filled one-block <b>pad</b> at its bottom layer: natural
 * ground (grass, dirt, moss, stone, gravel, sand, a puddle) mixed with built ground (cobblestone and smooth
 * stone roads, deepslate tiles, concrete). Vanilla's {@code beard_thin} adaptation raises terrain to that
 * pad and carves a smooth Gaussian above it, then the template overwrites its whole box — so the pad stamped
 * a flat plane of foreign ground over the world's surface, and the template's <em>air</em> cut a vertical
 * face into any hillside inside the footprint.</p>
 *
 * <p>This processor splits the template into base and structure:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Base</b> — a pad block that is natural ground ({@link #BASE}), and the plant cover on top of the
 *   pad (bushes, carpets, vines, anything replaceable). Yielded to the world wherever the world already
 *   holds natural ground there, so the biome's own surface shows through; kept where the world is air, so a
 *   pad hanging over a dip has no holes.</li>
 *   <li><b>Air</b> above the pad — yielded to the world's water wherever the building stands in it (the
 *   water level runs through the rooms), and to ground while the world column from the pad up to it is
 *   contiguous natural ground, so a hill on the uphill side leans into the outer rooms as a smooth ramp.
 *   The contiguity walk keeps no shelf over a gap.</li>
 *   <li><b>Structure</b> — everything else (roads, pavements, walls, floors, props, and natural blocks above
 *   the pad such as planters) is placed as the template says.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The buildings generate with terrain adaptation <b>off</b> ({@code StructureTerrainAdaptationMixin}):
 * vanilla's {@code beard_thin} would level the footprint before any of this ran. So the world's own ground
 * runs through the box untouched — where a hill stands higher than the pad it climbs over the lower floors
 * and buries them (walls and floors are still placed inside it) — and where the pad hangs over lower ground
 * on the downhill side, {@code BeardifierMixin} draws the terrain up to it ({@link LostCitySeating}) and
 * {@link #finalizeProcessing} props up what that skirt leaves hanging with a footing column: dirt under
 * natural pad blocks, stone under roads and plazas, down to the ground or {@link #FOOTING_MAX_DEPTH}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Attached at runtime by {@code SinglePoolElementMixin} to every pool element that places a
 * {@code big_lost_city} template — Big Lost City's own pools and every copy that points at them (this mod's all-biome buildings, other mods' copies) alike. Runtime-only, never
 * serialised, so {@link #getType()} is a unit codec. Reads the world only inside the placement box:
 * {@code processBlockInfos} runs processors before the chunk-box filter, and a read outside the region
 * would throw.</p>
