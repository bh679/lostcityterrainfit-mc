 * places, so during placement the chunk's structure references name every Lost City piece whose box
 * reaches a position — the piece being placed among them. A position inside {@link #MIN_PIECES} or more
 * such boxes is an overlap: there {@link LostCityGroundProcessor} lets the template's air yield to
 * whatever the earlier building left, so the two meld instead of the later one carving its rooms through
 * the first.</p>
